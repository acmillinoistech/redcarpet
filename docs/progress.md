### 2/10/2019 (Vinesh)

- Set up project with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- Added [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) stylesheet because:
    - Using Bulma allows us to focus on layout instead of writing lots of CSS from scratch
    - Bulma includes all the CSS classes we might need
    - Vinesh is very familiar with the framework
- Created a `Tile` component. Is this the best name for the component?
